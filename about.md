Hi, nice to meet you! Born and raised in France, I now live in Southern California with my wife and our dog and cat. üçä I have a professional background in art history, project management, and business coaching. After running a coaching business, I joined the customer service field where I delivered the best possible experience to clients in IT and accounting support. Today I am pursuing my love of software engineering.

When I am not coding and learning new languages, I am usually found hiking, gardening or playing video games.
